Gemma's activation function should be approximate GeLU and not exact GeLU.
Changing the activation function to `gelu_pytorch_tanh`.if you want to use the legacy `gelu`, edit the `model.config` to set `hidden_activation=gelu`   instead of `hidden_act`. See https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/29402 for more details.
